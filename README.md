# Mechanical-Project
The goal is to estimate the Modulus of elasticity (MOE) of wood staples using Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data. NIR spectroscopy is a non-destructive, rapid, and low-cost technique. The objective of this project is to investigate whether NIR data can accurately replicate the conventional mechanical testing process to determining MOE.
